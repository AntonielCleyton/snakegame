Snake Game

Description

The Snake Game project is a classic arcade-style game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food items to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake itself. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as possible without crashing into any obstacles.

Features

Control the snake's movement using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Food items appear randomly on the game board.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Keep track of the player's score.
Restart the game after game over.
